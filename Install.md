# Misc Install notes
  -  when rpm -i splunk._____rpm
  - (May get an error useradd: cannot create directory /opt/splunk -> check to see if /opt/splunk IS created
  - su - splunk (switch user to splunk user)
  - DO NOT RUN SPLUNK AS ROOT
  - enable splunk to start at reboot (must be set up as root)
  - chown -R splunk:splunk /opt/splunk (if perms do not add up)
  - if PID is not dead then kill -9 #PID

# Best case run
  - turn on machine
  - Use winscp to move splunk rpm to splunk machine
  - chmod 644 splunk-___.rpm
  - chmod +x splunk-___.rpm
  - sudo -s
  - rpm -i splunk-___.rpm
  - su - splunk (turn splunk on and off as splunk user)
  - cd /opt/splunk/bin
  - ./splunk start --accept-license --answer-yes
      -   - Will be prompted to create a local admin account: use admin and easy to remember password(update keepass!!)
          - GO UPDATE THE KEEPASS
  - ./splunk stop
  - exit (go back to root user)
  - cd /opt/splunk/bin
  - ./splunk enable boot-start -systemd-managed 1 -user splunk
  - systemctl start Splunkd
  - # Enable correct ports
  - ensure ports are open (in powershell tnc -p 8000 #target ip address)
  - sudo -s
  - firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=8000/tcp --permanent
  - firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=8089/tcp --permanent (or use ^8000^8089)
  - firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=9997/tcp --permanent (or use ^8089^9997)
  - firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=9100/tcp --permanent #9100 being used for replication port for indexers
  - firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=8191/tcp --permanent (critical for kvstore[where clusterd knowledged objects to replicated too])
  - firewall-cmd --reload #rereads to make what a change, (puts things in effect)

  # Set up Cluster Manager
  - Log into cluster master machine backend
  - Move base config file (this is tribal knowledge) to /tmp (using CDS)
  - move into /tmp
  - change ownership: chown -R splunk:splunk base_config_file_manager_base
  - change name if desired to something unique ie: J_base_config_file_manager_base
  - cd to /opt/splunk/etc/apps/j_base_config_file_manager_base/local
  - vi server.conf
  - under [clustering] ensure mode is manager, replication factor is whatever is defined, and search factor is whatever is defined
  - change the pass4symkey (once enterered it will be encrypted) -> enter in keepass
  - mv the file under /opt/splunk/etc/apps
  - login into web UI
  - under clustering:manager node, ensure there are no peers configured

  - # set volumes on indexers (base configs)
-  winscp base config files: org_cluster_indexer_base, org_indexer_volume_indexes to the /tmp file on the indexer
  -  rename each to desired name ie: j_cluster_indexer_base, and j_indexer_volume_indexes : :mv org_cluster_indexer_base j_cluster_indexer_base"
  -  change ownership : chown -R splunk:splunk j_cluster_indexer_base, and j_indexer_volume_indexes
  -  in cluster_indexer_base you must change some configs in some files. Drill down into local
  -  leave app.conf,inputs.conf(for now) and indexes.conf alone
  -  in server.conf: in the [clustering] stanza, change manager uri to the ip address and port of cluster manager ie: manager_uri = https://12:213:123:12:8089, add the same pass4symmkey from cluster manager in as well. Change replication_port to ://9100. in the [license] stanza change the manager_uri to the ip address the license manager ip. ie: manager_uri = https://34:232:235:98:8089
  -  in web.conf under the [settings] stanza change startwebserver = true. For the time being. You will turn this back false later in the build.
  -  in _indexer_volume_indexes you must also change data in indexes.conf
  -  change to [volume:hot], path =/ hot #or whatever the hot directory is called change the maxVolumeDataSizeMB to the hot volume size. You must add a [volume:cold], define path to path = /cold, change the maxVolumeDataSizeMB to the cold volume size

  - # Join indexer to Cluster (Peering)
  - use base config: org_cluster_indexer_base
  - go down to /opt/splunk/etc/system/local
  - edit [clustering] stanza
  - manager_uri = IP address of cluster manager:8089
  - mode=peer
  - pass4symm = the pass4sym established by the cluster manager
  - # Cluster Manager Base configs
  - winscp cluster_manager_base and org_all_indexes to server
  - change ownership and rename to something appropiate
  - in org_all_indexes inside of indexes.conf change homepath to volume:hot/xindex/db # this needs to be done globally. theres a shortcut to do this in vi (enter that here) (do I need to change the coldpath to volume:cold?)
  - move org_all_indexes to manager-apps. ie: mv org_all_indexes
  - in cluster_manager_base, traverse down into server.conf. in the [clustering] stanza ensure mode = manager, replication factor =3 and search factor =2 (this is deployment dependent). define pass4symmkey here. (update keepass)
